**This is organized as three tables:**

- Answers contains the body, creation date, score, and owner ID for each of the answers to these questions. The ParentId column links back to the Questions table.
- Tags contains the tags on each question
For space reasons only non-deleted and non-closed content are included in the dataset. The dataset contains questions up to 19 October 2016 (UTC).
